# PawnsTakeNaps
Pawns may now choose to take a nap during the day. Restful naps give pawns good thoughts and a hediff with a small boost to consciousness, but sometimes pawns will wake up groggy, suffering a negative thought instead.  [h1]Factors Affecting Naps[/h1] Pawns will take a nap if: [list][*]It is during night-owl hours (between 1000 and 1700) [*]They aren't too awake to fall asleep [*]They haven't had a recent restful nap [*]Their lord toil allows them to rest in a bed [*]They aren't assigned for full sleep or meditation[/list]  Pawns have strong individual preferences for naps, including how willing they are to skip work or recreation for a nap. Pawns are more likely to nap when they are tired, uncomfortable, in pain, and have had plenty of recreation (bored pawns would usually rather play than sleep).  [h1]FAQ[/h1] [b]1. Can I add/remove this from an existing game?[/b] Probably, but you will get errors if you remove it while pawns have a nap-associated thought or hediff.  [b]2. How does this affect performance?[/b] This adds a nap-check whenever pawns are looking for a job so I did have performance concerns. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a very low impact on a full colony test. If you have performance concerns, this mod should benefit from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2573814850]Rim73[/url].  [b]3. Is this compatible with this <Mod>?[/b] Probably. There are no changes to vanilla code or defs, so this mod will have wide compatibility.
