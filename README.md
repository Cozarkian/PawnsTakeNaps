# PawnsTakeNaps
Pawns may now choose to take a nap during the day. Restful naps give pawns good thoughts and a hediff with a small boost to consciousness, but sometimes pawns will wake up groggy, suffering a negative thought instead.  

**Factors Affecting Naps**

Pawns will take a nap if: 
* It is during night-owl hours (between 1000 and 1700) 
* They aren't too awake to fall asleep 
* They haven't had a recent restful nap 
* Their lord toil allows them to rest in a bed 
* They aren't assigned for full sleep or meditation

Pawns have strong individual preferences for naps, including how willing they are to skip work or recreation for a nap. Pawns are more likely to nap when they are tired, uncomfortable, in pain, and have had plenty of recreation (bored pawns would usually rather play than sleep).  

**FAQ**
1. Can I add/remove this from an existing game?
  
    It's safe to add. It's generally safe to remove, but you will get errors if you remove it while pawns have a nap-associated thought or hediff.  

2. How does this affect performance? 

    This adds a nap-check whenever pawns are looking for a job so I did have performance concerns. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find a very low impact on a full colony test. If you have performance concerns, this mod should benefit from [Rim73](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2573814850).  

3. Is this compatible with [ModName]?

    Probably. There are no changes to vanilla code or defs, so this mod will have wide compatibility.
